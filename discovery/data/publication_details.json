    "title": "Cabo Verde Country Climate and Development Report",
    "abstract": "Cabo Verde\u2019s climate exposure, partly also because of its geography, is compounded by economic vulnerabilities. The country has experienced robust economic growth since the early 1990s and achieved a substantial reduction in poverty, but growth has been volatile and has slowed in recent years. Reflecting the comparative advantage of its attractive natural geography, growth has primarily been driven by the tourism sector, which accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product (GDP), over half of exports, and most foreign direct investment. For similar reasons, the archipelago is heavily reliant on imports, notably those of fuel and food. High levels of remittance and concessional international financing serve to bridge its external financing needs, but they generate additional external vulnerabilities. Adding to this, although recurrent fiscal deficits have recently resorbed, public spending is rigid, and public debt remains above 100 percent of GDP. The COVID-19 pandemic put Cabo Verde\u2019s external vulnerabilities on display, causing a steep decline in tourism revenue and a surge in the food and fuel import bill before the economy returned to pre-pandemic conditions in 2023. This CCDR analyzes how Cabo Verde can build climate resilience and stimulate low carbon development, while identifying key enablers. The Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) estimates the projected economic and social damage from climate change in chapter 1. The report then proceeds to a discussion of the country\u2019s relevant institutional and legal framework in chapter 2, the main ways in which a climate-resilient economy can be achieved at the water-land nexus and through the blue economy and infrastructure systems in chapter 3, the green transition in the energy, transport, waste, and digital sectors in chapter 4, the core actions to support the private sector and people to become more climate shock-resilient though social protection, and finally, the skills needed for, and the strengthening of, the health system in chapter 5. Chapter 6 brings together the recommendations presented in the earlier chapters, estimating their costs and benefits and modeling their effects on the economy.",

    "abstract": "The Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) for Tanzania identifies the impact of climate change on the country\u2019s economy. The CCDR uses macroeconomic, climate, sectoral, institutional, and financial models to identify the economy\u2019s exposure to climate risks and the opportunities to integrate climate action and development. High poverty levels and dependence on rainfed, low-productivity agriculture leaves Tanzania\u2019s economy vulnerable to climate risks. By 2050, climate change could push an additional 2.6 million people in poverty and force up to 13 million Tanzanians to migrate internally. The CCDR presents how implementation of three multisectoral intervention areas could generate climate-positive, resilient, and inclusive growth in Tanzania by 2050. These are: integrating climate considerations when strengthening human capital and social protection; optimizing land and water use and management to boost agriculture and rural productivity, augment climate resilience, and lower greenhouses gas emissions; and prioritizing resilient and low-carbon transport, energy and digital infrastructure systems in urban areas and different sectors. The CCDR details governance arrangements for effective climate change action, presents investment needs, and describes options for mobilizing financing. Action is needed both to reduce vulnerabilities of Tanzania\u2019s current economy and realize the country\u2019s Vision 2050 goal of a more inclusive and sustainable growth trajectory. Targeted climate action could boost private investment and job creation, enabling Tanzania to meet its development objectives in the face of global risks.\n\nTechnical background reports prepared for the CCDR are available upon request.",

Three pathways are presented: \"Peace and Prosperity,\" \"Status Quo,\" and \"Escalation and Intensification\", each reflecting different levels of fragility and capacity for climate action. This framework underscores the importance of adaptive strategies that can respond to changing circumstances, prioritize targeted interventions, and foster a resilient and sustainable future for Yemen, with the analysis focusing on three major pillars: (i) Catchment to coast, addressing water and food security and the blue economy; (ii) Disaster risk management and resilient infrastructure , covering urban areas, transport, and the power sector; and (iii) Adaptive human development, examining human capital, health systems, and gender and inclusion. Recommendations are framed around five Higher Level Objectives: (i) Develop spatially targeted, scalable and people centered area-based approaches to build resilience and reduce multidimensional poverty; (ii) Improve water and food security and build a resilient fisheries sector amid uncertainty; (iii) Promote disaster risk management and climate-resilient power service provision centered around renewable energy; (iv) Foster adaptive human development by advancing health and human capital, prioritizing women and vulnerable groups; and, (v) Scale up innovative climate finance and empowering the private sector through people centered approaches.",

    "title": "Djibouti Country Climate and Development Report",
    "abstract": "Climate change threatens Djibouti\u2019s development goals and without effective adaptation, could generate economic losses equivalent to nearly four years of today\u2019s output by mid[1]century. Climate change exposes Djibouti to more frequent extreme heat, drought, and floods. These events threaten the infrastructure and services that serve the vibrant trade sector and that could enable a more diversified economy. Other sectors prioritized for diversification, including fisheries, information and communications technology (ICT), and tourism, are also directly impacted by climate change. Unless Djibouti adapts, climate change will also have a particularly negative impact on the livelihoods of the poor, on workers\u2019 productivity, and on water and food security. This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) estimates that even a limited set of priority adaptation actions may require 1.1 billion in additional funds, including an additional 77 million per year through 2035. Such investment can be consistent with Djibouti\u2019s goal of achieving both growth and debt sustainability, but it needs to be accompanied by economic reform and additional adaptation resources provided on a concessional basis. International support is particularly warranted given the regional importance of the resilience of Djibouti\u2019s economy.",

Climate-smart development policies offer a pathwayto address long-standing structural barriers to growth and accelerate convergence with European Union(EU) standards. Renewable energy and energy efficiency scale-up are crucial for improving the country\u2019senergy security but will require substantial investments as well as full implementation of sectoral reformsto accelerate integration with EU energy markets. Adaptation investments are key, not only to manage theimpacts of climate shocks, but also to raise productivity in the most vulnerable sectors. Most funding willneed to come from the private sector, while public sector investments need to be substantially augmentedby development partners. With smart macro-fiscal policies, Moldova has the opportunity and potential toimplement these ambitious measures and lay the foundations for sustainable and resilient growth.",

It highlights the economic and energy security advantages of transitioning from a gas-dependent to a solar-powered economy while acknowledging Armenia\u2019s vulnerability due to its energy-intensive structure. The report emphasizes the urgency of adaptation investments to mitigate water stress, land degradation, and natural disasters, with a particular focus on boosting water efficiency and storage and adopting climate-smart agricultural practices. Key policy recommendations include fiscal and institutional reforms, alongside substantial investment needs in critical sectors such as energy, water, agriculture, and public infrastructure. Achieving a resilient, low-carbon pathway will require an estimated $8 billion investment between 2025 and 2060 (2.5% of GDP per year), with the benefits expected to outweigh the costs. The report also stresses the essential role of private sector engagement and innovative financing, including public-private partnerships and a sustainable finance framework, to mobilize the necessary resources.",

    "abstract": "The Tajikistan Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) explores the impact of climate change and global decarbonization on Tajikistan\u2019s development. It identifies key areas to enhance climate resilience and deepen decarbonization and outlines priority recommendations for a successful green transition in Tajikistan, requiring structural reforms, climate-conscious policies, and inclusive strategies for a resilient and sustainable future.\n\nDespite economic growth and poverty reduction over the past two decades, Tajikistan's reliance on natural resources and remittances has led to unsustainable development, depleting natural capital and limiting job creation. The government\u2019s green transition plan focuses on renewable energy, promising energy security, economic growth, and regional electricity exports. However, further efforts are needed for a resilient development path, including a complementary reform program to bring significant economic benefits, climate adaptation, and low-carbon development that will benefit Tajikistan and Central Asia's electricity systems.\n\nClimate change poses significant risks, threatening water security, agricultural productivity, and infrastructure, potentially reducing GDP per capita by 5-6% by mid-century and pushing 100,000 people into poverty. Additional adaptation measures are crucial, focusing on water management, resilient landscapes, climate-smart agriculture, and disaster risk management. A low-carbon development pathway offers a more resilient and prosperous future, with near net-zero emissions in energy and waste sectors by 2050, boosting economic growth, and job creation and reducing air pollution. Achieving these goals requires substantial investments and institutional reforms to mobilize private capital and attract green foreign investment. Development partners can provide financial assistance, technical expertise, and capacity building.",

    "title": "Senegal Country Climate and Development Report",
    "abstract": "Climate action offers an opportunity to safeguard development gains and accompany the ambitious transformation Senegal is embarking on to achieve its objective of reaching middle income status in the next decade. While the country was among the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), poverty reduction was slow, vulnerabilities persisted, and inequalities increased. In addition, overall productivity remained low, with lagging structural transformation, high informality, and low job creation. To attain its middle-income goal, Senegal must initiate a series of reforms for a productive, sustainable, and inclusive growth model, with climate considerations at the center given the country\u2019s high vulnerability. Senegal\u2019s high climate vulnerability is caused by the country\u2019s coastal exposure and reliance on natural resources for food, jobs, and growth (partly a consequence of its slow structural transformation). With temperatures soaring, precipitation expected to decrease, and erosion threatening 75 percent of the coastline at term, Senegal\u2019s population and assets are under high risk. The poorest are particularly vulnerable, with 55 percent of total households teetering on the edge of poverty because of recurrent shocks. Without action, annual economic losses could reach 3-4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as soon as 2030 and further increase to 9.4 percent by 2050, wiping years of per capita income growth and eroding any potential human capital accumulation. Overall, climate change could push two more million Senegalese in poverty by mid-century.\n\nBuilding resilience and leveraging the low-carbon economy will help Senegal realizing its growth ambitions, contributing to a more productive, sustainable, and inclusive development pathway. The macro-economic analysis for this CCDR finds that adaptation measures in selected sectors could bring GDP gains of about 2 percent by 2030, and between 0.5 and 1 percent afterwards (for climate financing needs of about 0.9 percent of GDP in the period to 2030 and 0.1 percent afterwards). Adaptation could also reduce poverty headcount, with 40 percent less people pushed into poverty by climate change compared to no adaptation action. In addition, emission reductions could reach 20MtCO2e per year over the period to 2050, from interventions in forestry, improved cooking services, urban transport, waste management, and energy production.\n\nThe energy transition provides an opportunity to meet both development and climate objectives, exceeding NDC targets and putting the country well on track for net zero by 2050, but significant downside risks remain, linked to delays in the deployment and financing availability for renewable generation and domestic gas. Senegal\u2019s formidable renewable energy potential (chiefly around solar) offers the lowest cost generation option to meet rising energy demand while accelerating decarbonization. At term, the country could play a leading role in decarbonizing the region though export opportunities and bolster resilience across the regional grid. In the short term, given constraints to the fast deployment of renewables, the transitional use of domestic gas will help phase out expensive and high-emitting coal and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) generation, while balancing the electricity system and lowering the cost of electricity. Climate action will require a financing of US$8.2 billion over 2025-30 (in present value, at 6 percent per year), or 4.5 percent of discounted cumulative GDP over the same period, and US$10.6 billion over 2031-50 (in present value terms), or 2.0 percent of discounted cumulative GDP over the same period. Water security, sustainable (urban) transport, and the energy transition account for the largest share. Importantly, climate action is expected to bring significant benefits over time, beyond climate adaptation and mitigation \u2013 including health or jobs, (as in the primary sector, with 155,000 jobs created, of which 80 percent in agriculture). Many benefits could not be properly estimated, implying that the returns from climate action might well be underestimated.",

    "abstract": "The Country Climate and Development Report assesses how Poland can reap the benefits of faster decarbonization while reducing its vulnerability to climate shocks.\n\nAccelerating decarbonization is in Poland\u2019s economic interest. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will add an average 0.2 percent of GDP a year, leading to a cumulative 4 percent gain by 2050. At the same time, the reduction in air pollution brought about by decarbonization can lead to additional gains in terms of labor productivity and avoided mortality.\n\nA comprehensive transformation of the energy system is crucial to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. This will entail removing barriers to renewable penetration, strengthening Poland\u2019s transmission and distribution grid, using natural gas uniquely as transition technology, scaling up electricity trade, and repurposing current coal subsidies to mitigation of social end economic impacts in affected, vulnerable communities. Decarbonizing energy supply is also critical to cut the private sector\u2019s carbon emissions to maintain competitiveness as global low-carbon efforts accelerate.\n\nIncreasing carbon sinks and limiting emissions in the agricultural sector and are vital for Poland\u2019s green transition. Polish forests store 10% of all EU forest carbon and more than a decade of the country\u2019s emissions. But their sink role has been declining. Rehabilitating forestry sinks will require improved forestry management and expansion of forest areas through the conversion of marginal, underutilized and low-productivity agricultural land.\n\nResilience investments will be needed to lessen the impact of climate shocks. Despite its relatively favorable geography, Poland is not immune from increased temperatures and more severe and frequent floods and droughts. In the absence of adaptation investments, impacts on infrastructure, agriculture and labor productivity could lead to GDP losses of 1.2% by 2050. Relatively modest resilience investments (equivalent to 0.1% of GDP) in sectors including agriculture, water, forestry and transport over the next 25 years can reduce the economic costs of climate shocks almost fully by 2050, and by half a decade earlier.\n\nFor Poland, achieving prosperity in changing climate is affordable and within reach. But with the set of key policies and investments requiring implementation between 2025 and 2035, clear policy direction and effective implementation in the short term will be crucial to achieve the country\u2019s decarbonization and resilience objectives by mid century.",

This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) finds that Madagascar\u2019s aspiration to evolve into an emerging country by 2040 will be derailed unless it can bolster its resilience to intensifying climate shocks to safeguard its modest development gains and boost economic growth. The high frequency of extreme climate shocks since the 1970s has led to significant macroeconomic disturbances and weak growth. This CCDR examines the implications of future climate change for Madagascar\u2019s growth, and the potential benefits of both structural reforms and adaptation investments. It outlines three priority areas for building resilience to climate change, and calculates the costs needed to achieve this. It provides detailed recommendations for finding the finance required, as well as for implementing the policy challenges identified.",

    "abstract": "Guinea-Bissau is endowed with a wealth of natural resources, with the highest natural capital per capita in West Africa (US3,874 dollars per capita), which could be leveraged for sustainable and resilient growth. However, Guinea-Bissau faces significant development hurdles, such as high poverty rates, political instability, and economic challenges, including an over-reliance on cashew nuts. Rural poverty has increased, and the nation's infrastructure, education, and health care systems are underdeveloped. Climate change poses a severe threat, potentially impacting agriculture, fisheries, and infrastructure. Without adaptation, it could lead to a significant cut in real GDP per capita (minus 7.3 percent by 2050) and increase in poverty (with up to over 200,000 additional poor by 2050, that is, 5 percent of the expected population, in the worst scenario). The country's low greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise, mainly due to agriculture and land-use changes, with deforestation being a major contributing factor. Although Guinea-Bissau is a low emitter, it has high mitigation ambitions, targeting a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The Nationally Determined Contribution outlines significant climate actions, with initiatives focused on forest conservation, sustainable agriculture, and community development. However, the country's political instability, institutional weaknesses, and limited financial resources pose challenges to implementing these climate commitments, which depend heavily on external funding. The financial sector's underdevelopment and vulnerability to external shocks limit its ability to support green investments, though reforms could enhance resilience. Guinea-Bissau must consider its climate financing as development financing and vice-versa, engage the private sector, and integrate climate goals with national development plans to ensure a sustainable future. Concessional climate financing is vital due to the underdeveloped financial sector and the government\u2019s limited borrowing capacity. Addressing Guinea-Bissau's vulnerability to climate change and its structural issues requires a cohesive approach that integrates development and climate strategies. This could involve improving governance, diversifying the economy, protecting natural capital, developing human capital, and investing in sustainable agriculture and infrastructure. The transition to a more sustainable and inclusive development pathway that supports economic growth is possible, but requires focusing on key strategic sectors, enhancing institutional capacity, and creating the conditions to mobilize finance. As a highly vulnerable country, there are myriad needs in the different sectors; however, to be more efficient and effective, Guinea-Bissau should prioritize actions in a few sectors, especially actions on biodiversity, agriculture, and social protection. Low carbon development, especially in energy and forestry sectors, could provide cost-efficient solutions and attract climate finance, including from the private sector, which will support the overall development agenda.",

The report identifies key challenges, including frequent extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, deforestation, and weak institutional capacity. These challenges threaten the livelihoods of rural populations, exacerbate food insecurity, and hinder economic development.\n\nHowever, the CCDR also highlights significant opportunities for CAR to transition toward a more resilient and sustainable future. By promoting climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forest management, and renewable energy development, the country can mitigate the effects of climate change while unlocking new economic growth avenues. The report provides strategic recommendations to strengthen institutional capacities, integrate climate action into national development plans, and mobilize climate finance to support resilience-building initiatives.\n\nThe CCDR serves as a roadmap for operationalizing climate action in CAR, calling for stronger governance, enhanced stakeholder engagement, and innovative financing mechanisms to help the country adapt to climate challenges while promoting sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Mongolia\u2019s development prospects are uniquely challenged by both the impacts of climate change and the global shift toward a low-carbon economy. The country\u2019s efforts toward decarbonization pose significant challenges given the structurally high-emission intensity of its economy. While challenging, climate action also presents Mongolia with opportunities to achieve important development benefits. The effects of climate risks and the shift away from coal will have diverse impacts across different regions, communities, and socioeconomic levels. The report assesses the critical interconnections between Mongolia\u2019s development ambitions and climate change action and identifies ways to transition to a more economically diversified, inclusive, and resilient development path. It highlights key climate and transition risks affecting Mongolia\u2019s future development and presents a pathway to enhance climate mitigation and adaptation. The report also makes a case for strengthening policies to enhance resilience to climate change and ensure a just transition, particularly for the most vulnerable. The report is structured as follows: section 1 gives introduction. Section 2 delves into the linkages between development and climate in Mongolia and presents model-based findings on the economic and poverty impacts of climate change under different scenarios. Section 3 covers four in-depth sectoral analyses. The first two mainly focus on adaptation to climate change in the agriculture and water sectors. The third considers prospects for the extraction sector, while the fourth sectoral analysis focuses on decarbonizing power and heat generation. Section 4 shifts the focus to how the government can boost resilience for climate-vulnerable populations. Section 5 outlines options for mobilizing private and public financing and private investments to support the green transition. Section 6 examines the existing institutional and governance structure for climate action and presents recommendations to improve its effectiveness, and section 7 concludes with a framework for prioritizing the policy actions outlined in this report.",

    "abstract": "This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) explores the unique climate change challenge faced by the Pacific Atoll Countries (Pacific Atolls), the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and Tuvalu. It explores the key sources of climate vulnerability, as well as the development and adaptation strategies that are needed for preserving livelihoods, ecosystems, and the countries\u2019 long-term viability. The Pacific Atolls confront some of the most severe existential threats from climate change of any region in the world. This CCDR notes the urgent need for action on the part of each island country and the global community of nations in the face of severe climate change impacts. The CCDR provides the Pacific Atolls with near- and medium-term options to help them reach their long-term adaptation and development goals while also helping to reduce knowledge gaps on associated costs. These options include strengthening institutions, enhancing legal and regulatory frameworks, building human capital, and improving participation and consensus-driven decision making. It provides analysis of investments that could be used to protect islands from sea-level rise, safeguard water and energy supplies, and build the resilience and mobility of citizens. Increased domestic and international mobility is expected as citizens seek safer environments and economic opportunities. The CCDR shows that better education, health, and citizen engagement as well as traditional culture can support mobility and build a strong foundation for social and economic inclusion. Starting with an assessment of the Pacific Atolls\u2019 unique vulnerabilities (Chapter 1), the CCDR assesses governments\u2019 climate commitments and capacities (Chapter 2). It then presents options for adaptation that could address vulnerabilities and improve capacities (Chapter 3) before discussing financing opportunities and needs (Chapter 4). The CCDR concludes by presenting priority near, and medium-term policy options and trade-offs (Chapter 5), while recognizing that climate adaptation will require continued efforts well beyond the actions covered in this report.",

The four countries chosen as the focus for this report are the only OECS member countries eligible for concessional International Development Association (IDA) financing for development objectives. The report contributes to the identification of opportunities for OECS countries to achieve their development goals and increase resilience by responding to the challenges posed by climate change in four ways:\n\n1. It presents existing evidence on the challenges OECS countries face through multiple vulnerabilities - physical, social, and economic - and how they may deepen with climate change.\n\n2. It provides estimates of a significant subset of the investments needed for adaptation to natural hazards in these countries. Estimated needs are large; they stand between 1 and 11 percent of discounted GDP investments annually over a 15\u2011to\u201125\u2011year period, but the benefits they deliver through reduced risk and associated co\u2011benefits can also be large.\n\n3. By linking investment costs to the broader fiscal and growth context through a robust macro framework, it highlights the difficult balancing act between building resilience and ensuring debt sustainability.\n\n4. It identifies key actions that provide an opportunity to make headway on adaptation by building resilience to climate change while taking steps toward a more sustainable development path.",

    "abstract": "Ecuador is a middle-income country with abundant agricultural, oil, mineral, and hydropower resources and a challenging fiscal situation. Ecuador is already facing severe consequences from climate-induced hazards like droughts, floods, and rising sea levels, and these impacts are projected to escalate due to climate change. Ecuador\u2019s development, heavily reliant on the state and fueled by oil exports, is fiscally dependent on this commodity, and the global shift toward decarbonization can significantly reduce the demand for Ecuador\u2019s oil and agricultural commodities. Climate mitigation and adaptation actions combined with critical institutional and structural reforms will unlock Ecuador\u2019s productivity and strengthen resilience to shocks, putting the country on a path of higher, more stable growth. Successfully addressing climate challenges can be achieved by combining institutional, macro fiscal, and sectoral policies that integrate climate and development priorities and exploit their complementarities under a whole-of-the-economy approach.",

    "abstract": "This Regional Western Balkans Countries Climate and Development Report (CCDR) stands out in several ways. In a region that often lacks cohesive regional alliances, this report emphasizes how the challenges faced across countries are often common and interconnected, and, importantly, that climate action requires coordination on multiple fronts. Simultaneously, it illustrates the differences across countries, places, and people that require targeted strategies and interventions. This report demonstrates how shocks and stressors re intensifying and how investments in adaptation could bring significant benefits in the form of avoided losses, accelerated economic potential, and amplified social and economic spillovers. Given the region\u2019s high emission and energy intensity and the limitations of its current fossil fuel-based development model, the report articulates a path to greener and more resilient growth, a path that is more consistent with the aspiration of accession to the EU. The report finds that the net zero transition can be undertaken without compromising the economic potential of the Western Balkans and that it could lead to higher growth than under the Reference Scenario (RS) with appropriate structural reforms.",

    "abstract": "Zimbabwe is a lower middle-income country with abundant natural capital and growth potential, but is highly exposed to climate change, with its immediate ability to address climate challenges severely constrained. People in Zimbabwe are increasingly reliant on successive rounds of emergency relief rather than a formal government safety net. Macroeconomic constraints, deindustrialization, and land reform have combined to increase dependency on agricultural livelihoods and push up emissions from land use change. The macroeconomic constraints pose a double bind in which the inability to finance development, climate adaptation, and mitigation is leading to increased land degradation, higher net emissions, and less resilience. This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) identifies a path out of this double bind by linking demand from global green value chains to Zimbabwe\u2019s significant reserves of energy transition minerals (ETMs), such as lithium needed for electric vehicles, in a way that: (i) enables public and private sectors to invest in resilient low-carbon development; (ii) finances capital accumulation that could be deployed to support at-scale land restoration and increases agricultural productivity; and (iii) expands resilience-building social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable, helping them adapt to the expected increase in cyclical weather shocks.",

The region contains countries among the most affected by climate change but least prepared to address it. This report introduces key findings of the World Bank Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs) in the region. The CCDRs help align climate and development considerations for governments and other stakeholders and help prioritize actions that enhance adaptation and resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and align with broader development goals. Addressing these challenges and converting them into opportunities is crucial, including taking carefully prioritized, sustained action. Seven CCDRs have been published for MENA countries (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon1, Morocco, Tunisia, West Bank and Gaza), offering policy and investment options to harmonize climate and development objectives.

The dependence of Benin\u2019s economic structure on agriculture and informal employment makes its development path highly vulnerable to climate change in the absence of proper adaptation. The government and the private sector need to be better prepared to deal with climate change \u2013 building adequate institutions and governance structures will be crucial. While all sectors will have to become more resilient, this is especially urgent for agriculture and land use, urban and network infrastructure, and human development (education, health). Mitigation efforts should focus on avoiding carbon lock-ins and reducing deforestation. Investing in renewable energy whilst expanding the population\u2019s access to electricity should be a priority for Benin. A higher share of renewable energy can bring about co-benefits for other sectors (agriculture, water, transport, and forestry). To maintain its growth trajectory, Benin needs to pay special attention to its most vulnerable people, including women. To protect the poor and vulnerable the just transition should focus on reconciling development and climate goals while addressing inequality (income and gender related), and spatial exclusion.",

    "abstract": "The Dominican Republic has made significant progress in boosting economic growth and reducing poverty, but it still faces challenges to achieve inclusive and equitable development, increase productivity, and improve the competitiveness and sustainability of primary sectors like agriculture, water, tourism, and energy. The National Development Strategy (NDS) and the National Multi\u2011Year Public Sector Plan (NPSP) aim to address development and climate challenges and promote a green, inclusive and resilient future. The DR is highly vulnerable to climate change, which is likely to compound existing development challenges. By 2050, climate change impacts are expected to decrease labor productivity and affect health, crop yields, tourism, infrastructure capital, and natural ecosystems such as forests and coastal areas. Climate change also poses risks to the financial system such as the banking sector's heightened credit exposure to tropical cyclones and droughts. Although the DR has a small carbon footprint, the country's GHG emissions have been rising, mainly in the energy, waste, and agricultural sectors. Fostering a low\u2011carbon growth path can support the country's climate change goals while bringing important development co\u2011benefits. The Dominican Republic CCDR employs a version of the MANAGE model. This CCDR further extends the model to incorporate the path of emissions from key sectors (transport, energy, AFOLU), and to incorporate DR\u2011specific climate damage functions to introduce the impact of climate change on the economy.",

Building on extensive analyses and consultations (see Box 1 for our approach), the CCDR calls for a new model that emphasizes the role of the private sector in generating most jobs, while the state focuses on its regulating function, funding expenditures with the highest social and economic returns, and directing resources to interventions that are both economically and environmentally sustainable. The proposed model would involve major changes, such as using pricing to rationalize the consumption of resources and creating economic conditions that support private investments in climate adaptation and decarbonization. It would also involve a shift from recurrent public expenditures to public investments in adaptation and decarbonization.",

    "abstract": "The Kenya Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) aims to identify the impact of climate change on Kenya\u2019s economy. Through robust and rigorous analyses that cover climate impact modeling across multiple scenarios and the overall economy, sectoral issues, investment needs and potential sources of financing, the CCDR aims to identify high impact intervention areas that would support climate positive development. Action against climate change is imperative to avoid setting back Kenya\u2019s aspiration of being an upper-middle-income country and reducing poverty in the next decade. In a business-as-usual scenario, inaction under different climate futures could dampen real GDP by 1.25 to 2.4 percent by 2030 and 3.61 to 7.25 percent by 2050 compared to the baseline. Climate impacts Kenya\u2019s human, natural and physical capital and the impacts vary by region. By 2050, no climate action could also result in 1.1 million additional poor compared to the baseline under the pessimistic climate scenario, with communities in the arid and semi-arid areas being most hard-hit. Kenya can also be a key player in the global climate solutions arena if it maintains a low-carbon growth path. Kenya stands out among African and lower-middle-income countries due to its well-diversified and primarily low-carbon energy mix, with about 90 percent of electricity generation coming from renewable resources. Kenya could also generate carbon offsets through large-scale landscape restoration. The CCDR identifies five key action areas that could enable Kenya to meet its growth aspirations in an inclusive and climate-resilient manner. The three multisectoral action areas are: managing water, land, and forest for climate-resilient agriculture and rural economies; delivering people-centered resilience with climate-informed basic services and urbanization; and strengthening Kenya\u2019s competitiveness in international markets through shifts in energy, transport, and digital systems. It is necessary to complement these the three action areas with two crosscutting actions areas - improving integration and coordination of climate action in policy, planning, and investment decision-making across the economy, and developing and operationalizing policy measures for mobilizing climate finance from private and public sector. Implementing these action areas should account for regional differences to climate risk exposure.",

    "abstract": "C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is at a crossroads. Despite good progress over the last decade, recent global economic and health shocks have aggravated existing problems including lack of fiscal space, limited access to concessional and cheap financing, and a fragile political neighborhood. But C\u00f4te d'Ivoire now has an opportunity to put its growth on a more sustainable path, both realizing the aspirations of a growing population and better adapting to the growing impacts of climate change. Climate change impacts are already affecting C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, as temperatures increase, rainfall and other weather events become more extreme and less predictable, and sea levels rise. This World Bank Group Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) shows negative impacts from climate change will reduce economic performance and over proportionally impact the poor. The report examines specific opportunities in energy, agriculture, and land use as well as urban development and interconnectivity that could render the country\u2019s development more sustainable and inclusive, raising standards of living while increasing resilience in face of climate change. Dealing with a changing climate is a national imperative, where choices need to be made for the structural transformation of the economy, transitioning from outdoor low\u2011earning sectors such as agriculture to more value\u2011added industrial and service activities.",

    "abstract": "The Cambodia Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) provides analysis and recommendations on how Cambodia can achieve sustained development while responding to climate change and the low-carbon transition. Cambodia has high development aspirations, aiming to become an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a high-income country by 2050. Achieving these goals will not be easy and will require a more inclusive, diversified, and productive economy. Climate change could amplify existing development challenges, with potentially sizable impacts on growth, trade, debt, and poverty reduction, as Cambodia faces one of the world\u2019s highest levels of exposure to floods and extreme heat. However, building climate resilience also offers an opportunity, not only to mitigate climate risks, but also to concurrently further development outcomes, as this report finds that adaptation measures in Cambodia have large development co-benefits. Moreover, Cambodia has made ambitious pledges in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and in its Long-term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality (LTS4CN). Delivering these commitments will require careful policy choices to mitigate transition risks and seize development opportunities. Finally, as a small, open economy highly dependent on trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), Cambodia will be highly affected by the accelerated decarbonization and changing consumption and production patterns in the rest of the world. With the right policy choices and a vibrant private sector, this could offer opportunities for export diversification, job creation, and growth.",

    "title": "Republic of Congo Country Climate and Development Report - Diversifying Congo's Economy: Making the Most of Climate Change",
    "abstract": "The Republic of Congo (RoC) CCDR is a new World Bank core diagnostic report that integrate climate change and development considerations. It is intended to help the country prioritize the most impactful actions that can boost adaptation and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while delivering on broader development goals. The CCDR builds on data and rigorous research and identify main pathways to reduce climate vulnerabilities and GHG emissions, including the costs and challenges as well as benefits and opportunities from doing so. The report highlights that RoC could reduce poverty in rural areas by 40% and in urban areas by 20% by 2050 by implementing more ambitious reforms to promote economic diversification and climate resilience. It also concludes that business as usual is not an option. Economic losses could reach up to 17% of GDP by 2050 if reforms to diversify the economy and attract more climate investments are not taken. Climate impacts could also increase total health costs from $92 million in 2010 to $260 million by 2050. The report identifies four priorities to promote sustainable growth in the country: (i) stronger and greener infrastructure and services in electricity, transport, water, and sanitation can deliver transformative results; (ii) More climate-ready education, health systems and social services can save lives and bring critical resources to the poorest; (iii) More investments in natural capital including climate smart agriculture and greater forest management along will help create jobs while reducing carbon emissions; (iv) better climate governance to leverage carbon markets. The forest contributes to US$260 million in timber exports and store over 44 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Protecting and valorizing the forest is critical to turn the country\u2019s natural capital into wealth. The report emphasizes that the private sector has a critical role to play in mobilizing financing for an ambitious set of reforms and investments in the context of tight fiscal space. This will require raising awareness on risks and opportunities from climate change, and innovative solutions and financial sector reforms.",

    "abstract": "As Colombia navigates a complex path toward a richer and more equitable future, the country faces three critical climate transitions. First, it will need to transit from a climate\u2011vulnerable to a more climate\u2011resilient economy. Second, guided by its Long\u2011Term Climate Strategy (LTS) and strong legal framework, which place it among the climate\u2011goal leaders of the Latin America region, the country will need to navigate a transition to a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions economy in the context of its stated goal for 2050. Third, in a world that will demand increasingly less of Colombia's primary exports\u2014oil and coal\u2014and more green products, it will need to engineer a transition in its economic model. This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) explores the opportunities for, and challenges to, achieving Colombia\u2019s development goals and its ambitious climate commitments, as well as the complementarities between the two. It explores how climate change and climate action would affect the country\u2019s growth and development and, in turn, how growth and development challenges would affect the achievement of its climate ambitions. The CCDR also investigates complementarities\u2014specifically, how climate action could help Colombia achieve its development objectives, capture opportunities, support a just and inclusive transition, and protect its economy against longer\u2011term risks from climate change and from the world\u2019s transition toward net zero GHG emissions.",

    "abstract": "Honduras is highly vulnerable to extreme natural hazards, which are expected to increase because of climate change. These will have significant consequences for all of Honduran society, affecting important economic sectors and threatening food and water security and human health. The impacts of climate change are expected to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable, such as indigenous peoples and afro\u2011descendants (IPADs) and women. These impacts will likely compound existing challenges such as migration, internal displacement, and land conflicts and insecurity. Even though Honduras\u2019s contribution to global emissions is significantly low, the country has opportunities to pursue low\u2011carbon development that will create co\u2011benefits and foster synergies with climate change adaptation, particularly in the agriculture, water, forestry, energy, and transport sector. This CCDR recommends focusing on a parallel approach of a) cross\u2011sectoral recommendations in the short term that allow for the creation of an enabling environment for sectoral recommendations in the long term and long term, while b) accelerating policy reforms and investments through a phased approach for priority sectors. This phased approach to sectoral action would help the country gradually enhance ambition while also harnessing the enhanced institutional capacities and increased enabling environment.",

The impacts of global climate change risks and local practices on the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are of particular concern, as they provide vital ecosystem services to Brazil, the South American region, and the world. The Brazil Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) examines the implications of climate change and climate action for Brazil's development objectives and priorities. It identifies opportunities for Brazil to achieve both its development goals and its climate commitments. It lays out a combination of sectoral and economy-wide policy reforms, as well as targeted investments in near- and medium-term mitigation and adaptation measures to achieve more rapid and inclusive development with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The idea is to maximize synergies between climate and development objectives, while addressing trade-offs among policy objectives and key transition challenges.",

Indonesia\u2019s Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) takes a historical look at climate and development challenges in Indonesia to: (i) present a baseline for the future low-carbon and climate-resilient journey; and (ii) develop a framework to illustrate climate-growth dynamics. The framework is centered around Indonesia\u2019s abundant supply of carbon-intensive natural resources-land and energy-matched by high demand for those resources in parts of the economy that drive growth-agriculture, urban expansion, industry, transportation, and trade. The resulting emissions have direct and indirect costs. They erode climate resilience and increase costs from climate shocks. Rising carbon content in the economy also imposes sunk costs for the low-carbon transition. Although these challenges are known, and efforts are being made to tackle them, the framework aims to link these economy-wide issues to the ongoing and future reforms that are discussed in the CCDR.",

The CCDR offers a set of policy options and investment opportunities that, if implemented within five years, can deliver short-term benefits in selected sectors while also creating momentum toward important long-term benefits. The options identified in this report provide: Cost-effective adaptation approaches to reduce the negative impacts of climate change; Policy interventions to improve efficiency in the use of natural resources, and complement the creation of fiscal space to finance projects that reduce the vulnerability of people and the economy to climate shocks; Actions that can help avoid carbon lock-in through low-cost policy changes; Interventions to strengthen the country\u2019s competitiveness while reducing negative externalities (such as pollution) and incentivize Egypt\u2019s move towards a low carbon growth path in a manner consistent with its development objectives. Overall, the report identifies opportunities to reduce inefficiencies, manage risk, and strengthen the foundation for increased private sector participation.",

    "abstract": "The Argentina Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) explores opportunities and identifies trade-offs for aligning Argentina\u2019s growth and poverty reduction policies with its commitments on, and its ability to withstand, climate change. It assesses how the country can: reduce its vulnerability to climate shocks through targeted public and private investments and adequation of social protection. The report also shows how Argentina can seize the benefits of a global decarbonization path to sustain a more robust economic growth through further development of Argentina\u2019s potential for renewable energy, energy efficiency actions, the lithium value chain, as well as climate-smart agriculture (and land use) options. Given Argentina\u2019s context, this CCDR focuses on win-win policies and investments, which have large co-benefits or can contribute to raising the country\u2019s growth while helping to adapt the economy, also considering how human capital actions can accompany a just transition.",

    "abstract": "Climate change poses major risks for development in the Philippines. Climate shocks, whether in the form of extreme weather events or slow-onset trends, will hamper economic activities, damage infrastructure, and induce deep social disruptions. Adaptation to the risks of climate change, including both extreme events and slow-onset problems, is thus critical for the Philippines. Policy inaction would impose substantial economic and human costs, especially for the poor. Adaptation cannot eliminate the costs of climate change, but it can substantially reduce them. Many adaptation responses also contribute to mitigation; conversely, many mitigation measures generate local co-benefits, such as reduced air pollution. Although the Philippines is a relatively low emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG), it can contribute to global mitigation efforts through an energy transition, including a shift away from coal. The investment costs of such adaptation measures and an energy transition are substantial but not out of reach. The Philippines Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) comprehensively analyzes how climate change will affect the country's ability to meet its development goals and pursue green, resilient, and inclusive development. The CCDR helps identify opportunities for climate action by both the public and private sectors and prioritizes the most urgent development challenges impacted by climate change in the Philippines.",

    "abstract": "Integrating climate and development is a pillar of the World Bank Group\u2019s (WBG) Climate Change Action Plan 2021-25. To advance its implementation, the WBG has launched the Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR). This new, core diagnostic tool analyzes how a country\u2019s development goals can be achieved in the context of adapting to, and mitigating against, climate change. As such, the Pakistan CCDR provides analysis and policy recommendations on how to harmonize the country\u2019s efforts to achieve further economic growth and lower poverty rates, on the one hand, with the pursuit of a climate-resilient, low-carbon, and equitable development path, on the other. In light of the devastating 2022 heatwaves and floods and the country\u2019s vulnerability profile, the CCDR puts a strong emphasis on the need for building long-term resilience. Further, it explores pathways for Pakistan to achieve deep decarbonization by 2050, and eventually reach net-zero emissions by 2070 without undermining its development ambitions. It also provides assessment on technical, financial and institutional and governance frameworks needed for these climate transitions. Most importantly, it attempts to capture the centrality of people in climate policies by assessing how climate risks affect lives and livelihoods, and ways in which governments can build resilience and address poverty, distributional and job impact of climate change and climate actions. Lastly, it sheds lights on ways for Pakistan to galvanize cooperation between public and private sectors and support from international communities.",

    "abstract": "The Peru Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) provides analysis and recommendations on integrating the country\u2019s efforts to achieve economic development with the pursuit of emission reduction and climate resilience. The CCDR explores opportunities and trade-offs for aligning Peru\u2019s development path with its recent commitments on climate change. Peru is highly vulnerable to climate change and needs urgent adaptation action. Peru can benefit from decarbonization policies, thanks to its mining, forestry and agriculture, and renewable energy resources. Peru has many opportunities to develop and implement comprehensive climate policies that also increase productivity and reduce poverty. A low-carbon, resilient development for Peru would require substantial institutional reforms, in addition to public and private investments.",

    "abstract": "In Jordan, natural resource scarcity and import dependence mean pronounced climate change impacts are inevitable and adapting to climate change is a pressing development priority. A new World Bank diagnostic tool, The Country Climate and Development Report explores the linkages between climate and development and identifies priority actions to build resilience and reduce carbon emissions, while supporting economic growth and reducing poverty. The report indicates that Jordan\u2019s trajectory in meeting its climate and development goals will be largely determined by policy and investment choices in five strategic sectors - water, energy, agriculture, transport and urban development. The transformation of those sectors towards a resilient and low carbon path would need to be closely coordinated along two nexuses to maximize co-benefits and to reduce potentially negative socio-economic impacts: the water-energy-food security nexus, in a context of extreme water scarcity and pressing adaptation needs, and the urban-transport-energy nexus, which is at the core of the shift towards a low-carbon growth path. Jordan will need to use a combination of avenues to leverage financing for priority climate action. Selected policy reforms to improve the management of public investment in key sectors, attract and leverage private sector financing, incentivize end-users and change behaviors, and ensure greater engagement of the financial sector will all be essential for the achievement of Jordan\u2019s climate priorities. Equally important will be the identification of additional financing for priority investments, without which the country\u2019s climate commitments may remain out of reach.",

    "abstract": "South Africa's ambition is to build a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable economy. This ambition depends on the extent to which the country is able to shift from its heavy dependence on coal to low-carbon activities and to address the growing risks presented by climate change. This low-carbon path and adaptation must be people-centered, creating jobs and protecting the poorest in the most unequal society in the world. All of these require policies and actions with inevitable tradeoffs and some synergies. The South Africa Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) provides analysis and recommendations on integrating the country\u2019s efforts to achieve rapid growth, higher employment and lower inequality with the pursuit of a low-carbon and climate resilient development path. The CCDR provides a summary of key challenges and opportunities for the country's transition to a low-carbon economy in a just way. The report also provides assessment of what it takes (in terms of technical, financial and institutional and governance framework) for South Africa to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 without undermining its development ambitions. The report examines ways in which South Africa could adapt and build resilience to a changing climate. Finally, the report provides priority packages of policy recommendations that South Africa could implement to achieve its just transition to a low-carbon economy and society by 2050.",

    "abstract": "Ghana has achieved major development gains over the past three decades, but progress has slowed and there are causes for concern going forward. Ghana sought to fuel its development by leveraging markets, but debt sustainability is a concern, compounded by crises. Ghana\u2019s economic and human development is also vulnerable to climate change and climate-related shocks. While climate change cannot be solved by any single country, local actions can help manage physical and transition risks as well as bring large opportunities. This report explores the ways in which Ghana can pursue its development objectives while considering the challenges of climate change and the opportunities from the transition. It sets the stage in chapter 1 by documenting the various ways in which climate and development interact in Ghana, emphasizing that climate action can support development. Chapter 2 reviews Ghana\u2019s climate commitments and institutional readiness to carry them out. Chapter 3 lays out concrete actions that Ghana can consider to boost its resilience and productivity in key sectors while reducing its emissions and associated externalities. Chapter 4 models some of these investments and policies to assess their overall economic and social effects and explores financing options as well as ways to crowd in the private sector. Chapter 5 concludes by laying out priorities for the government to consider that are achievable and can yield development and climate payoffs simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Climate change poses a serious threat to Morocco\u2019s economic growth and human potential but with the right investments and policies in place, a more sustainable future is possible. A new World Bank diagnostic tool, The Country Climate and Development Report explores the linkages between climate and development and identifies priority actions to build resilience and reduce carbon emissions, while supporting economic growth and reducing poverty. The Morocco climate report identifies three priority areas \u2013 tackling water scarcity and droughts; enhancing resilience to floods; and decarbonizing the economy. The report also looks at the cross-cutting issues of financing, governance, and equity. The underlying message in the report is that if Morocco invests in climate action now and takes the appropriate policy measures, the benefits will be immense. Ambitious climate actions will help to revitalize rural areas, create new jobs and position the Kingdom as a green industrial hub, while also helping Morocco to reach its broader development goals. The report identifies key pathways to decarbonize the economy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and massively deploying solar and wind power. The report estimates that total investment needed to put Morocco firmly on a resilient and low carbon pathway by the 2050s would be around $78 billion in present dollar value. The good news is that these investments could be gradual and that with the appropriate policies in place, the private sector could shoulder much of the cost.",

Without adequate mitigation and adaptation efforts, climate risks will become a growing constraint to China\u2019s long-term growth and prosperity, threatening to reverse development gains. Conversely, if efforts to tackle climate risks lead to a significant decline in growth and rising inequality, they would deprive millions of people of development and likely erode support for the reforms necessary to achieve a lasting economic transformation. Hence, China will need to grow and green its economy at the same time. This report offers policy options to achieve these dual objectives by easing inevitable trade-offs and maximizing potential synergies between China\u2019s development and climate objectives.",

    "title": "Malawi Country Climate and Development Report",
    "abstract": "This Country Climate and Development Report aims to support Malawi\u2019s efforts to achieve its development goals within a changing climate by quantifying the impacts of climate change on the economy and highlighting key policies and interventions that are needed to strengthen climate resilience. The analysis includes climate modeling across multiple scenarios to account for the inherent uncertainty in climate projections; and sector-by-sector analysis and assessment of economywide impacts to identify the biggest impacts. It examines Malawi\u2019s current policy landscape and identifies needed reforms; considers how Malawi can best protect its most vulnerable households; and considers how the country can finance its ambitious development and climate agenda, including the key role of the private sector. The analysis shows that climate change will impose large costs on the economy and on already vulnerable households. If Malawi stays on its current low-growth development trajectory, climate change could reduce GDP by 3-9 percent in 2030, 6-20 percent in 2040, and 8-16 percent by 2050). The analysis also clearly demonstrates that development, as set out in Malawi\u2019s Vision 2063, provides a strong basis for strengthening resilience to climate impacts. If Malawi was to accelerate implementation of policies and programs envisioned in the Vision 2063 the development trajectory would shift to a higher growth path and climate change impacts would be significantly reduced. But the Vision 2063 development path will not be enough and building greater resilience to climate change will require doing different things and doing things differently. With additional adaptation measures, the analysis shows that not only is the impact of climate change on GDP much smaller, GDP is higher with climate change and adaptation when compared to the counterfactual with no climate impacts; losses range from -1 to 3 percent in 2030 and 2040, and 1 to 4 percent in 2050.",

    "abstract": "The Rwanda CCDR highlights key interventions that are needed in Rwanda to strengthen climate resilience in the context of country\u2019s development priorities and its commitments under the Paris Agreement. The CCDR finds that Rwanda\u2019s unconditional adaptation and mitigation commitments (i.e., the actions the country plans to implement through 2030 using existing and planned domestic and external financial resources) would substantially dampen the shocks to GDP resulting from increased weather variability. Unconditional NDC investments would boost industrial output and employment during project implementation compared to their baseline levels. The CCDR also finds that conditional actions boost the capital stock above the baseline by more than 4% on average in the late-2020s and by 1% towards mid-century. The additional climate investments in agriculture, energy, and infrastructure simulated in the CCDR could also accelerate the pace of structural transformation. Considering the current global and national fiscal context, finding the right balance between development and climate action will be instrumental for Rwanda to sustain its impressive growth rates and deliver its national development plan Vision 2050. The CCDR offers recommendations organized by priority areas, where sector-specific interventions and projects are presented.",

    "abstract": "This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) identifies ways that Nepal can achieve its overall development objectives while fostering its strategic ambition to transition to a greener, more resilient, and inclusive development pathway. This report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 captures the current situation in the country with respect to climate impacts and risks, emission sources, and opportunities for integrated climate change adaptation and mitigation. Chapter 2 describes the government\u2019s response, through sectoral and economywide commitments, laws, and regulations. Chapter 3 assesses the impacts of climate change on the macroeconomy and road transport systems, given their critical role to connectivity. It also analyzes the links between climate change and air pollution, poverty, health, social inclusion, and community resilience. Chapter 4 presents pathways to transition to resilience, looking at integrated management of landscape systems comprising water, agriculture, and forests as well as strengthening climate and disaster risk management governance. Chapter 5 analyzes pathways to transition to decarbonization, primarily the potential for hydropower expansion domestically and in the region. It also looks at transport and urban opportunities to reduce emissions while enhancing resilience and adaptation co-benefits. Chapter 6 discusses how to scale up financing for resilience, hydropower, and other opportunities, given the limitations of the country\u2019s fiscal space. Chapter 7 presents a prioritization framework for the most transformational climate action with seven \u2018policy packages\u2019\u2014one for each priority transition and each key enabler\u2014that contain specific recommendations for how to move from analysis to action.",

    "abstract": "Like most countries in the world, Vietnam is increasingly seeing its development affected by climate change. With a coastline of 3,260 kilometers that includes major cities and production sites, Vietnam is highly exposed to sea-level rise. Climate change impacts on the Vietnamese economy and national welfare are already significant\u2014about 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020\u2014and they are expected to escalate rapidly even if greater efforts are made to mitigate future climate change around the world. Vietnam has historically had very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but over the past two decades, it has seen some of the fastest emissions growth rates in the world. From 2000 to 2015, as GDP per capita increased from $390 to $2,000, per capita emissions more than quadrupled. Vietnam\u2019s GHG emissions are associated with toxic air pollution in many of its cities today, with implications for health and labor productivity. At the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021 (COP26), the Prime Minister made several commitments, including an ambitious target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. Vietnam\u2019s increased attention to climate change and the environment reflects the growing economic costs of resource depletion and climate impacts, which have already started to harm trade and investment\u2014 two key drivers of the nation\u2019s robust growth and job creation in recent decades. Vietnam now faces critical questions about how to respond to climate change: How intensively should it work to adapt to previous and predicted damages caused by climate change, given the uncertainty of global mitigation efforts? How much will it cost to reduce GHG emissions? How can the private sector be mobilized to help achieve Vietnam\u2019s climate goals? Are there trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation investments? Are there trade-offs between economic growth, poverty reduction, and climate action, and how can they be managed? Which sectors and regions should be prioritized? What are the distributional implications of a low-carbon, climate-resilient growth path? The Vietnam Country and Climate Development Report (CCDR) investigates these questions. One of the first in a series of country-level diagnostics produced by the World Bank Group (WBG) under its 2021\u20132025 Climate Change Action Plan, the CCDR examines the adaptation and mitigation challenges faced by Vietnam. It pays special attention to policy trade-offs and provides recommendations to help policy makers prioritize among a range of options, recognizing uncertainties about future climate change impacts and the availability of technology and financing.",

    "abstract": "The five countries of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger (the G5) in the Sahel region of Africa are among the least developed countries in the world. The now regular and growing climate shocks are causing large losses in outputs, reducing human capital accumulation, and leading to potentially devastating ecological and economic tipping points in the region. This World Bank country climate development report (CCDR) has examined the most critical actions and policy changes needed to accelerate the region's economic recovery, sustainable and inclusive development, and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. This report has three main messages. First, the opportunities for a resilient and lower-carbon development of the G5 countries are significant. They can reverse environmental degradation and maximize the benefits of climate action for the poor. Second, rapid, resilient, and inclusive growth is both the best form of adaptation to climate change and the best strategy for meeting development goals in an effective, sustainable, and productive manner. Third, the costs of inaction are far greater than the costs of action. Early and targeted action on policies and programs presented in this report can move the G5 Sahel countries towards a greener, more resilient, prosperous, and inclusive future.",

To advance its implementation, the Bank Group has launched a new, core diagnostic tool: the Country Climate and Development Report, a new, core diagnostic tool that analyzes how a country\u2019s development goals can be achieved in the context of adapting to and mitigating against climate change. These reports will reflect the country\u2019s climate commitments and identify ways to support their implementation through public and private sector solutions. They will capture the centrality of people in policies on climate change adaptation and mitigation, assessing how climate risks affect people, and ways in which governments can build resilience and address poverty, distributional and job impact of climate change and climate action. The Turkiye Country Climate and Development Report explores how climate action, in line with the country\u2019s mitigation goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2053 as well as its adaptation and resilience needs, interact with its growth and development path and contribute to achieving the country\u2019s development objectives, help seize opportunities offered by green technologies, protect the economy against longer-term risks such as large-scale disasters or carbon lock-in as the world transitions towards zero-carbon technologies, and support a just and inclusive transition for all.",

    "abstract": "The Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) identifies ways that Cameroon can achieve its overall development objectives while fostering the transition to a greener, more resilient, and more inclusive development pathway. The CCDR finds that climate change is already a threat to Cameroon\u2019s development and the country faces the challenge of changing the current development model to create opportunities to improve resilience and to put the country on a stronger development trajectory. Currently, about two million people (nine percent of Cameroon\u2019s population) live in drought-affected areas, and about eight percent of the country\u2019s GDP is vulnerable. Tropical forests cover almost 40 percent of the country and provide an estimated eight million rural people with traditional staples including food, medicines, fuel, and construction material. Changes in temperature, rain and droughts put these people at greater risk of increased poverty. Furthermore, populations living in certain regions are more vulnerable to climate hazards, especially in the Far North where debilitating droughts have contributed to alarming rates of food insecurity and loss of livelihoods. To achieve more rapid, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, moving away from the state-led development model, and putting the private sector at the forefront of economic activity are needed. Without reforms, the proportion of the population subsisting on an income at or below the international poverty rate would still be about 15 percent in 2050, well above the global target of three percent, whereas changing the development model could bring that proportion down to about three percent by that year. The report also puts adaptation at the heart of climate action as well and identify four priority areas for intervention and which are: (i) agriculture, forestry and other land use; (ii) cities; (iii) infrastructure; and (iv) human capital.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is already affecting people\u2019s lives and livelihoods in Angola, as well as the Angolan economy. The country is experiencing increasingly severe and frequent climate hazards, including the South\u2019s worst prolonged droughts in decades. Climate change impacts also come with a heavy price tag: climate-related disasters (floods, storms, droughts) cost Angola nearly US1.2 billion dollars between 2005 and 2017, and on average droughts alone affect about a million Angolans every year. Impacts of climate variability on Angola\u2019s water resources are expected to be particularly severe and will affect food and energy production, as well as hydropower, on which Angola relies for most of its electricity. The future does not look much brighter: climate models predict a rise in temperatures, with most of Angola becoming 1\u20131.5 degree Celsius warmer in 2020-2040 relative to the 1981\u20132010 period, with a 1.4-degree Celsius increase in the annual average temperature already recorded. The imperative to adapt and transition to a proactive model for climate risk management is urgent. Against this backdrop, and the equally urgent priority to diversify away from a highly oil-based economy, the Angola Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) provides options for the country to adapt to a fast-warming and decarbonizing world and adopt measures for more diversified and climate-resilient development that will underpin sustainable and inclusive growth. Angola has significant renewable capital, including agricultural land, forests, water resources, and, above all, its people, who can facilitate this process. But climate change also threatens these renewable assets, and necessary investments in climate resilience will be critical to realize their potential. This report identifies five pathways to achieve a vision of a future Angolan economy that is both diversified and climate-resilient, with opportunities for all. Tailored to the national context, these approaches were identified in dialogue with the Government of Angola and build on national development priorities. Angola is rich in natural capital, not only oil, gas, and diamonds, but also abundant water resources, renewable energy potential, and fertile arable land. Therefore, to shift away from an economy driven by oil and gas extraction and toward a sustainable and diversified economy based on renewable natural capital, this CCDR recommends investing in and building the resilience of key sectors, notably 1) water resources, 2) agriculture and fisheries, and 3) renewable energy. Delivering the vision of a climate-resilient and diversified economy also entails 4) enabling green and resilient cities with economic opportunities for all Angolans; and leveraging Angola\u2019s young population by 5) boosting human capital, through expanded, climate-resilient access to basic services and by fostering a culture of climate preparedness.",
