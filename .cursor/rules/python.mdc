# Python dependency management

This project uses `uv` to manage dependencies and run Python files.

Add Python dependencies to the workspace like:

```bash
uv add pydantic # add --dev flag for development dependencies
```

Then run the file as a module with `uv run -m`.

# Python programming patterns

Write type-annotated Python code that will pass a mypy check. Objects returned from functions should generally be Pydantic models rather than dictionaries; this helps enforce the interface between modules.
