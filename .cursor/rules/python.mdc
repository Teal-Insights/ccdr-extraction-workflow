There is no Python virtual environment for this repository, but if you insist on witing and running Python scripts, you may do so with `uv`, which is installed systemwide.

Create a self-contained file with lazy self-installation of dependencies via the following shebang syntax at the top of the file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "playwright",
# ]
# ///
```

Then run the file with with `uv run`, like:

```bash
uv run main.py
```
