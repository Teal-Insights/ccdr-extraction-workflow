This repository contains workflows and scripts for:

1. Scraping data or documents from the Internet
2. Transforming the scraped examples into structured JSON data
3. Embedding the data for semantic search
3. Uploading to a PostgreSQL database

Working documents and helper files not meant to be retained may be placed in the `artifacts` folder, which is ignored by git.

To avoid confusion, you should keep your bash console opened to the project root folder and should specify all file paths in relation to the project root.
